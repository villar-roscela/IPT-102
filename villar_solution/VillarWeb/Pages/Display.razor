                    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy containing our solar system,
                    spanning about 100,000 light-years in diameter. It's composed of billions
                    of stars, planets, and cosmic material, with a dense center called the galactic bulge.
                    The solar system is located about 27,000 light-years from the center in one of its spiral arms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interesting fact: The Milky Way is moving at around 600 km/s through space,
                    and it will eventually collide with
                    the Andromeda galaxy in about 4.5 billion years!

                <p class="card-text">
                    The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and various smaller
                    objects like asteroids and comets. The planets orbit the Sun due to its gravitational pull,
                    with Earth being the third planet from the Sun. The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interesting fact: 99.86% of the solar system's mass is concentrated in the Sun,
                    making it the dominant force governing all planetary orbits!

                <p class="card-text">The eight planets are split into two groups: rocky terrestrials and giant gas/ice worlds.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Mercury – The smallest and closest to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations.
                    Venus – Similar in size to Earth but with a toxic atmosphere and intense heat.
                    Earth – The only planet known to support life, with water in liquid form.
                    Mars – Known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface.
                    Jupiter – The largest planet, a gas giant with over 75 moons.
                    Saturn – Famous for its stunning ring system, made mostly of ice and rock.
                    Uranus – An ice giant that rotates on its side, giving it unique seasons.
                    Neptune – The farthest planet, known for its deep blue color and strong winds.
